# CWGCN

The code and weights have been released, enjoy it！ You can easily run the model！ To use the pretrained models at checkpoint/ and evaluate the models performance run:  test.py


## Code Structure
checkpoint folder: contains the trained models

dataset folder: contains ETH, UCY and SDD datasets

model.py: the code of CHGNN

test.py: for testing the code

utils.py: general utils used by the code

metrics.py: Measuring tools used by the code

The specific code of the training part will be released after the paper is officially published!

## Model Evaluation
You can easily run the model！ To use the pretrained models at checkpoint/ and evaluate the models performance run:  test.py
